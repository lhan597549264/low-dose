### 2. Train!
```
./train --dataroot datasets/<dataset_name>/ 
```
This command will start a training session using the images under the *dataroot/train* directory with the hyperparameters that showed best results according to CycleGAN authors. You are free to change those hyperparameters, see ```./train --help``` for a description of those.

Both generators and discriminators weights will be saved under the output directory.
